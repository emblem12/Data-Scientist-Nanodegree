>NumPy
>Pandas
>Seaborn
>Matplotlib


## 2. Project Motivation


>Aircraft never crash because of a single issue. It’s almost always a combination of factors that lead to an accident. Whilst flying is extremely safe, the typical reasons as to why planes crash include pilot error, technical failures, bad weather, terrorism, and pilot fatigue.

> This project was inspired by the dire concern of aviation safety with the dataset acquired from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airplane-crashes-and-fatalities. The below CRISP-DM methodology will be incorporated to analyze the data.

> There is never one single cause attributed to pilot an aircraft crash. For example, if the aircraft suffers a serious technical problem (but one that shouldn’t result in the loss of an aircraft) and its subsequently mishandled by the pilots resulting in a crash, does that count as pilot error or mechanical breakdown? The mechanical breakdown on it’s own shouldn’t have meant the plane crashed, but could have been handled correctly by the pilots. Therefore, both are causal factors. Some of the questions that will be analyzed are as follows:

> What type of aircraft is involved in the most crashes ?
> What is the correlation between Fatalities of Passengers to Numbr Aboard ?
> Which Locations Recorded the Most Crashes ?
> Which Operating Airlines Recorded the Most Crashes ?


## 3. File Description

> There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.
